## Excerpt from United Nations Economic and Social Council Resolution of 19 February 1948

... whereas the co-ordination of the cartographic services ... will result in significant economies in cost, time and personnel, and will contribute to the improvement of cartographic techniques and standards;

The Economic and Social Council therefore recommends:

1. That the Member Governments stimulate the accurate survey and mapping of their national territories;

2. that the Secretary-General take appropriate action, within the limits of budgetary availabilities; 

... to further such efforts by promoting the exchange of technical information and other means, including the preparation of a study on modern cartographic methods and development of uniform international standards; 

... to develop close co-operation with cartographic services of interested Member Governments.
